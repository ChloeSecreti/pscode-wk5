// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for number
if num % 2 = integer, then print even
if num % 2 != integer, then print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


ask for 5 numbers (a, b, c, d, e = list) 
add list together to find sum (a + b + c + d + e = sum) 
Divide sum by 5 = average
read list, define smallest number as minimum 
read list, define largest number as maximum 
print average, minimum, and maximum
